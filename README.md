## Project Status

`MayEden` is currently in maintenance mode. New features are not actively being added but existing features and new versions of discord are supported as possible. There are some major architectural changes which need to be added to improve the stability and security of the project. I don't have as much spare time as I did when I started this project, so there is not currently any plan for these improvements.
